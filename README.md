## What is [Fragments](https://fragmentsbycoder.netlify.app)?

>Fragments is a prototype of [Xper](https://github.com/Jaagrav/Xper) 2.0 which will allow you to code, execute and view them in RealTime on all platforms
that you visit your website from. 
However in Fragments, you can create/edit/store code and snippets for future use. Fragments would soon become a text editor for PC and Mac after 
I implement [electronjs](https://github.com/electron/electron) into this project.
